# mod-gauntlet

A Gauntlet of Bosses!
A simple turn-based roguelike.

Fight a series of increasingly difficult mobs as a party.

Some features include:
  - Progression and leveling system
  - Randomized mob spawns with randomized stats
  - Randomly generated classes and characters for different parties
  - Interctive icons to view attack and statuses
  - Replayabililty?

This game basically a super watered down version of pokemon. 

Try playing it once!
